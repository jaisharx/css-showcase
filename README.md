# Welcome to my CSS-Showcases

## This Repository
This repo is collection of few small toy projects that which I've worked on over the period, they showcase different css techniques and modern methods used in CSS nowadays.

## Usage
This repo uses parcel for serving and optimizing static files.
So you'd wanna install parcel globally first, if you haven't already.

```sh
npm i parcel -g
```

After successfully installing parcel.<br>
Navigate into your desired dir and run the following commands.
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Do an ```npm build``` for building production ready files.
