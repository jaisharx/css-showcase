# Welcome to my CSS-Showcases

## This Repository
This repo is collection of three different CSS based projects, all of which are configured with parcel, and are hosted on netlify.

## Usage
Wanna tinker around the projects, navigate into them ([Natours](https://github.com/jaisharx/css-showcase/tree/master/Natours), [Trillo](https://github.com/jaisharx/css-showcase/tree/master/Trillo), [Nexter](https://github.com/jaisharx/css-showcase/tree/master/Nexter)).

## Getting Started

In order to get started with the projects, run the following command in the root dir. 

```bash
npm install
```
Once all the necessary dependencies are installed (it's really just parcel configured) the ```package.json``` comes with three pairs of ```start``` and ```build``` npm scripts for each of the projects.

For example, if you want to start a dev server in watch mode run:-
```bash
npm run start:trillo
```

or this if you want a production ready dist folder
```bash
npm build start:trillo
```

Each project is configured and hosted on netlify, if all you want to do is just 'em how they look. Simply navigate to the desired directory, and follow instructions.
